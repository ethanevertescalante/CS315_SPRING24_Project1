Hello, My name is Ethan Escalante. I am currently a Junior at Sonoma State University studying Computer Science.

Here you will find some of the projects I have recently been working on. Check out the projects tab, which is label by year and language of the project.

I am actively searching for new opportunites to grow and learn as a human and a professional in all aspects of my life. Especially in the field of Computer Science!
